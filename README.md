# Java Playground
This repository is a personal playground for experimenting with Java code.

It includes various examples, exercises, and projects to help improve Java programming skills.

## Key Learning Goals

The Primary focus of this repository is to enhance understanding of Java concepts, including:
* Build Tool
  * To effectively configure `Gradle` using the `Kotlin DSL`.
* Modern Java
  * Advanced Stream API
  * Lambda Expressions
  * Streams
  * Record Classes
  * Sealed Classes
  * Pattern Matching
  * Virtual Threads
* Spring Framework
  * Spring Boot
  * Spring Data JPA
  * Spring WebFlux
  * Project Reactor

## ðŸ’¡ Project Philosophy

This project is organized into **self-contained packages**, each focusing on a specific concept or feature.

The goal is for each package to be an independent, runnable "mini-project."

This approach allows for focused experimentation without creating complex dependencies between different examples.

If necessary, utility code may be duplicated to ensure each package can be understood on its own.
